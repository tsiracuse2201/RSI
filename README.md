This code will fetch the stock data for the specified ticker between the start and end dates, and then calculate the RSI using the Close prices and a time period of 14. The resulting data will include the original Close prices and the RSI values.

You can adjust the time period as needed to suit your specific requirements. It's also important to note that the RSI is just one technical indicator and it's generally a good idea to use a combination of indicators to make investment decisions.
